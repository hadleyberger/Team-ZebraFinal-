# Team-ZebraFinal-
A platform game designed by Hadley Berger, Autumn Chapman, Mckenzie Evans

We created a platform game using Unity. We were able to change the colors and the scene of the platform game. We also imported a new asset to change the actual player. You need the assets folder and Unity to play this game. To play, press play and use the arrows to move, space bar to jump.
We made it by modifying the 2-D platform game on Unity Hub
